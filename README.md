### GitHub Branches

Currently only have one 'main' branch as the master working branch.

In collaboration with other people, I will need other branches.

Its time to branch out.

clarification: fork vs branch

fork: when you create your own copy of the code on your local machine and in your GitHub repository. Its yours.

branch: working on branch means you are sharing with other user. When you push to the branch, the other user can see as well.

A test branch call 'dev', where collaborator would work on before submitting a pull request

Features will be work on dev branch, once consider stable, it can be merge onto the main branch.
